A mini-implementation of [Fractional](https://fractional.art/). Each NFT that intends to be fractionalized would be turn into a vault by utilizing a clone factory (Vault Factory). NFTs can be fractionalized, bought, and sold. When the NFT is bought, fractional owners can redeem their tokens for ETH.
